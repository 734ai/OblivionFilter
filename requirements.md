# üï∂Ô∏è OblivionFilter - Requirements & Specifications

## Project Overview
OblivionFilter is an advanced, privacy-focused content blocker based on uBlock Origin, designed for stealth operations, censorship resistance, and Manifest V3 compatibility. This project targets red team operations, airgapped environments, and regions with heavy internet censorship.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Manifest V3 Resistance & Compatibility
- **Primary**: Full Manifest V2 support for maximum filtering capabilities
- **Fallback**: Manifest V3 compatibility mode with native proxy bridge
- **Hybrid**: Automatic detection and switching between MV2/MV3 modes
- **Native Mode**: Standalone proxy server for out-of-browser filtering

### 2. Stealth & Anti-Detection Features
- **Anti-Adblock Bypass**: Advanced script injection to fool detection systems
- **DOM Cloaking**: Invisible filter application without detectable signatures
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Randomized request patterns and timing
- **Fingerprint Resistance**: Browser fingerprint randomization support

### 3. Censorship Resistance
- **Decentralized Updates**: GitHub raw, IPFS, and P2P filter list distribution
- **Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet connectivity
- **Local Rules**: Complete filter rule management without external dependencies
- **Resilient Packaging**: Multiple distribution formats (.crx, .zip, unpacked)

### 4. Performance & Scalability
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient filter rule storage and lookup
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded filter evaluation
- **Caching System**: Intelligent rule and resource caching
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand component initialization

### 5. Security Features
- **Zero Telemetry**: No data collection or remote analytics
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Isolated filter rule execution
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Signed filter lists and updates
- **OPSEC Compliance**: No identifying headers or user-agent modifications

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Components

#### Core Engine
- **Filter Engine**: Advanced regex and domain-based filtering
- **Cosmetic Engine**: CSS injection and DOM manipulation
- **Script Engine**: JavaScript injection and modification
- **Network Engine**: Request interception and modification

#### Platform Support
- **Chromium**: Chrome, Brave, Edge, Ungoogled Chromium
- **Firefox**: Standard and ESR versions
- **Native Proxy**: Standalone filtering proxy (Go/Python)
- **Mobile**: Android Firefox and Kiwi Browser support

#### Filter Types
- **Network Filters**: URL blocking, redirection, modification
- **Cosmetic Filters**: Element hiding, style injection
- **Scriptlet Filters**: JavaScript injection and behavior modification
- **Procedural Filters**: Advanced DOM-based filtering

### Performance Targets
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB for typical browsing sessions
- **Filter Evaluation**: < 1ms per request for 99% of cases
- **Startup Time**: < 500ms extension initialization
- **Rule Compilation**: < 5s for 100k+ filter rules

### Compatibility Matrix
| Browser | MV2 | MV3 | Native | Status |
|---------|-----|-----|--------|--------|
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | Full   |
| Firefox | ‚úÖ   | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ      | Full   |
| Safari  | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | Partial|
| Edge    | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ      | Full   |

## Filter List Sources

### Primary Sources
- **EasyList**: Standard ad blocking rules
- **EasyPrivacy**: Privacy protection rules
- **uBlock filters**: Additional blocking rules
- **Custom Lists**: Specialized regional/contextual filters

### Decentralized Distribution
- **GitHub Raw**: Direct repository access
- **IPFS**: Distributed file system storage
- **Tor Hidden Services**: Censorship-resistant access
- **Local Files**: Fully offline operation
